Your stomach aches as you move towards the host. You hate coming here but today it was your only option.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">the Dining Hall is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">The familiar chaos of the college dining hall surrounds you. The air is filled with the sound of clattering plates and a fire music playlist. Various food stations line the walls, each with their own unique line of hungry students. A large sandcastle sits in the middle of the room, vaguely themed around the 4th of July. It seems there was some sort of accident surrounding the castle as a human sized dent lays waste to the majority of the left side. You have heard many stories of this place, all of which seem to vanish from your brain upon entry...</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Secret Dining Hall is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">Behind an unassuming wooden door, tucked away in a quiet corner of campus, lies the Lunaris Hall, the secret dining oasis that feels more like a dream than reality. As you step inside, youre greeted by a soft, golden glow emanating from ornate crystal chandeliers that dangle like stars from the high, vaulted ceiling. Rich mahogany tables are adorned with silk table runners and polished silverware, while lush velvet chairs in deep emerald green beckon you to sit and savor the experience.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The air is filled with the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread, rich truffle oil, and sizzling rosemary steak. A grand buffet stretches the length of the room, laden with gourmet dishes that could rival any Michelin-starred restaurantlobster bisque served in hand-carved bowls, delicate sushi rolls crafted with precision, and desserts that are miniature works of art, glistening under the soft light.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">In the center of the hall stands a live cooking station where chefs in crisp white coats prepare custom orders with theatrical flair, flames dancing in their pans. Soft classical music hums in the background, harmonizing with the gentle clinking of glasses and hushed laughter of an elite crowd who have discovered this hidden treasure.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Every detail of Lunaris Hall whispers luxury, from the fresh bouquets of exotic flowers on every table to the golden accents etched into the walls. This is no ordinary dining hallits a secret sanctuary for those who crave indulgence, elegance, and the finest cuisine. To dine here is to momentarily escape the mundane and step into a world of decadence.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 1 - Swiping In</p><p class="indent0">Interrogative is a kind of value. </p><p class="indent0">The interrogatives are what, which, how, where, eat, swipe, and can.</p><p class="indent0">Current question is an interrogative that varies.</p><p class="indent0">Found secret ending is a truth state that varies.</p><p class="indent0">Swipe Card is a truth state that varies.</p><p class="indent0">Questions asked is a number that varies.
